			Hi! My anme is Kathryn Kingsberry and I'm an A+ certified technical support specialist. I currently work for a software company that creates databses for non-profits to track their funding and program activities. During the day I assist clients with troubleshooting data entry errors, setting up their database to allow them to track client information, and extracting data entry by generating reports. If I'm not following up with organizations or conducting remote teaching sessions, I'm traveling to these organizations, located throughtout the U.S. and its territories, to conduct workshops on the software. I love my job! Not only because I enjoy my position in tech support, but because it also provides me with the opportunity to explore my passion in web development.

		<p>As I gained knowledge testing the software and learning what makes the system tick, I was inspired to learn HTML/CSS and am also studying both front-end and back-end languages in UCLA's coding bootcamp. The languages I'm becoming fluent in addition to HTML and CSS are JavaScript, Firebase, and MySQL to name a few.
		My goal is to utilize the knowledge I've gained from my current career, personal study, and code course to become a back-end web developer.
